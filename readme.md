# ChatPrefix

## Introduction
ChatPrefix is a plugin created using the [Source.Python](https://github.com/Source-Python-Dev-Team/Source.Python) server plugin for Source-engine games.  As such, it requires [Source.Python](https://github.com/Source-Python-Dev-Team/Source.Python) to be installed on your Source-engine server.  It currently only supports CS:S, CS:GO, and TF2.

This plugin adds prefixes to chat messages.
